Flex Add-in for NUnit

This is an extension to the standard NUnit test attributes that allows for a mix of both function based TestCaseSource as well as TestCase style "Rows". The add-in also supports basic permutability for test cases to simplify getting full coverage. For details about the various ways to use it and do permutations please refer to the Examples project that is part of this project.
